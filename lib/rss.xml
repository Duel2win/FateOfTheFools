At the end, The Prophet started mumbling about various things too quiet to hear. When you enter you see a room filled with many holes, glowing with an ethereal golden glow. A white stone 13ft in diameter chained over a ritual table slowly glows a burning light. Once you arrived, you provoked him really funnily and he made the decision of transporting a melee fighter within 5ft of him. He died in two rounds.

As mechanical servants of the library rush you all, the stone glows brighter and the floor looses space until the glow envelops you, leading to something new... <br>.<br>

<br>Although the Destination is always the same, the journey is the thing that gives life it's purpose

<br>Everyone dies, and everyone experiences death and all it's hardships, however the world's natural cycle is often found more pleasant living with the smaller things

<br>Having Friends, Experiencing the sounds of nature


<br>The world is vast, and so is the people's curiosity. If people go straight from one point to another, they are technically alive, but with no purpose.

 <br>A One sentence summary of the note itself. Helps to identify the purpose of the note, the XXX<br><br>Three to Five<br>
<br>A fantasy based world, with a early industrial revolution technology revolution.

<br>The main world that I will be continuing with in the future, but with a loose timeline. This world is primarily a generic fantasy, with some of the higher levels of magic being unable to be cast by non-players (7th level max), and as such technology was given a chance to make an impact to everyone regardless of their magical status.
<br>Why a fantasy world (Other than it being DND)?

<br>Fantasy is what I like the most, as I can mould it to what I want it to be. Short and sweet.


<br>Why Technology was introduced?

<br>For the Out-of-universe reason: I wanted to create an atmosphere outside of what everyone at the table knew, while also giving the world a consistent logic to it. Technology was the best way to do it, giving the players something new to interact with and to additionally show that the world is able to evolve to the needs of the people inside it.
<br>For the in-universe reason: Technology was always attempted, but due to magic being more powerful it was overlooked. This was until the discovery of <a data-href="Bloodstones" href="Bloodstones" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodstones</a> and mages finding the hard limit of magic (Currently 7th level). The hard limit of magic forced the world to look to other solutions, rather than the convenient one they known for centuries on end. <a data-href="Bloodstones" href="Bloodstones" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloodstones</a> on the other hand basically acted like a powerful fuel source for all their inventions, with the added benefit of it being similar to something they already knew (Magic), even if they did not know where it comes from.


<br>What is the Max Spell Limit?

<br>Although the reason alludes people nowadays, there seems to be a wall cast on a magic user's potential. Some theorise that it is the natural limits of mortals, others think that it is requiring a new way of harvesting magic, however it seems that some theorise it to be and artificial obstacle to serve some greater purpose.

<br>It seems to be at the 7th level spells at the moment, and requires Arcane Checks (Where relevant) to find out more information.




<br>Bloodstones? What is that?

<br>Think of it as a power source coming in primarily five different flavours: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and "Pure". Each of them are used to either enhance your current magic or to act as a fuel for a device specialising in one of the different elements.
<br>"Pure" Bloodstones seem to be XXX


<br>General Note


<br>A world with untold history, with many civilisations living, thriving and dying while only leaving behind their ancient monuments.

<br>The world is an ancient place, and not everything that now exists

<br>Environment

<br>What type of environment is this location built inside of (Or generally has been)?
